            <h3 class="orange-highlight">2024 - Present | Learning level </h3>
            <p>As a student of Computer Science and Engineering (CSE),
                I am gaining hands-on experience with industry-standard tools and technologies such as VS Code, GitHub,
                and various programming frameworks.
                These tools are strengthening my understanding of software development, algorithms, and system
                architecture.
                I am always eager to expand my skills and will continue exploring new technologies to enhance my
                capabilities in the future.

            <h2>System Analysis</h2>
            <h3 class="orange-highlight">2024 - Present</h3>
            <p> As a CSE student, I am developing strong skills in system analysis, focusing on understanding how
                software, hardware, and user requirements work together to create efficient solutions.
                I analyze system workflows, identify functional and non-functional requirements, and break down problems
                into structured, logical components.
                My work involves exploring system design principles, data flow modeling, and identifying optimization
                opportunities to improve performance, usability, and reliability.
                I enjoy examining real-world problems and translating them into clear system solutions that align with
                user needs and technical feasibility.</p>
